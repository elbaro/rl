Due to its intuitive and biological appeal (Badre & Frank, 2011; Botvinick, 2012), the field of HRL
has been an active research topic in the machine learning community for many years. A number
of different architectures for HRL have been proposed in the literature (Dayan & Hinton, 1993;
Kaelbling, 1993; Parr & Russell, 1998; Sutton et al., 1999; Dietterich, 2000; Florensa et al., 2017;
Heess et al., 2017).

We consider two paradigms specifically – the options framework (Precup, 2000)
and goal-conditioned hierarchies (Nachum et al., 2018b), due to their impressive success in recent
work (Frans et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2017; Nachum et al., 2018a; 2019), though an examination of
other architectures is an important direction for future research.
